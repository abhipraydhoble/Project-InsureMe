InsureMe was having trouble managing their software because it was all one big piece. </br>
As they grew bigger, it became even harder to manage. <br>

### $\color{orange} \textbf{Requirements}$

#### 1. Automated Deployment:</br>
Whenever a developer makes changes to the code and pushes them to the master branch of the Git repository, </br>
Jenkins should automatically start a deployment process.
</br>
#### 2. CI/CD Pipeline: </br>
Jenkins should: </br>

* Check out the latest code from the master branch.
* Compile and test the code to ensure it works correctly
* Package the application into a container using Docker.
* Deploy the containerized application to a preconfigured test server on AWS

With DevOps Approch I used several devops tools such as  <br>

- Git: Managed code changes with version control. </br>
- Jenkins: Automated integration, testing, and deployment processes. </br>
- Docker: Containerized applications for consistency and scalability. </br>
- Ansible: Automated server configuration and infrastructure management. </br>
- AWS: Provided infrastructure for hosting and deploying the application. </br>
 Together, these tools streamlined development, testing, and deployment, ensuring efficient management of the InsureMe project. </br>

### $\color{orange} \textbf{Project} \\ \textbf{Summary}$

- Create two EC2 instances on Amazon Web Services (AWS): one called Master and the other called Node.
- These servers will host application and manage its deployment.
- Install Jenkins on the Master server to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying application.
- Set up Jenkins to watch your code repository on GitHub.
- Whenever someone makes changes to the code and pushes them to GitHub, Jenkins automatically kicks off a process to update and deploy application.
- Used Docker to package application and its dependencies into a container, making it easy to deploy and run anywhere.
- After that write a pipeline in Jenkins to build, test, and deploy your application automatically.
- This pipeline runs every time someone makes changes to the code, ensuring that the latest version of your application is always available.
- Whenever someone pushes changes to the code, Jenkins pulls the latest code, builds the application, creates a Docker image, and pushes it to DockerHub (a service for storing Docker images).
- Then, it deploys the updated application to your servers on AWS using Ansible, a tool for automating server configuration.
- With this setup, you  can fully automated process for building, testing, and deploying your application.
- Whenever someone make changes to the code, Jenkins takes care of the rest, ensuring that your application is always up-to-date and running smoothly on your servers.</p>

# $\color{red} \ \textbf{Steps}$
## $\color{green} \textbf {Tech Stack}$
✓ AWS - For creating ec2 machines as servers and deploy the web application. </br>
✓ Git - For version control for tracking changes in the code files </br>
✓ Jenkins - For continuous integration and continuous deployment  </br>
✓ Docker - For deploying containerized applications </br>
✓ Ansible - Configuration management tools  </br>

## $\color{bluew} \textbf{step 1: Create Infrastructure}$
Create two ec2 instance 
1. Master
2. Worker 
### Set Up Master Node
1. ami = ubuntu
2. instance type = t2.medium
3. ports =  22, 8080

Take SSH and Connect to Instance
## $\color{bluew} \textbf{step 2: CI/CD Setup}$

### Install Jenkins for Automation:
### Install Jenkins on the EC2 instance to automate deployment: Install Java
```` 	
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install fontconfig openjdk-17-jre -y

sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install jenkins -y
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
````

Access Jenkins in a web browser using the public IP of your EC2 instance.
$\color{pink}{publicIp:8080}$

### Install Necessary Plugins in Jenkins:

#### Goto Manage Jenkins →Plugins → Available Plugins →

##### Install below plugins:
1.Maven Integration plugin  </br>
2.Docker  </br>
3.Docker Commons  </br>
4.Docker Pipeline  </br>
5.Docker API  </br>
6.docker-build-step  </br>
7. stage view

##### Add tools in  Dashboard->Manage Jenkins-> Tools

![JENKINS-TOOLS](https://github.com/kajol2699/Project-InsureMe/assets/130952932/9e92b0b3-e7db-4257-9287-7d49006d130f)

#### Create Job in Jenkins : go to Dashboard->Item Name

![JOB](https://github.com/kajol2699/Project-InsureMe/assets/130952932/0485ed2e-3795-477a-ac64-508ec8bef2d1)

As soon as the developer pushes the updated code on the GIT master branch, the Jenkins job should be triggered using a GitHub Webhook and Jenkins job should be triggered
In Jenkins Job ->Configuration->choose GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling

![WEBHOOK-JEN](https://github.com/kajol2699/Project-InsureMe/assets/130952932/81253cac-b3b6-4816-ac18-b044e671ee3d)

To Create Webhook: go to settings of your github repository 
In Payload URL: Add yours jenkins url

## $\color{bluew} \textbf{step 3: Install  Docker}$
````
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
sudo systemctl restart jenkins
sudo chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock
````
Add DockerHub Credentials:

To securely handle DockerHub credentials in your Jenkins pipeline, follow these steps: </br>
Go to "Dashboard" → "Manage Jenkins" → "Manage Credentials." </br>
Click on "System" and then "Global credentials (unrestricted)."  </br>
Click on "Add Credentials" on the left side.    </br>
Choose "Secret text" as the kind of credentials.  </br>
Enter your DockerHub credentials (Username and Password) and give the credentials an ID (e.g., "docker"). </br>
Click "OK" to save your DockerHub credentials. </br>

```groovy
pipeline {
    
     agent any

    stages {
        stage('Code-Checkout') {
            steps {
              checkout scmGit(branches: [[name: '*/master']], extensions: [], userRemoteConfigs: [[credentialsId: 'github-token', url: 'https://github.com/abhipraydhoble/Project-InsureMe.git']])
            }
        }
        
        stage('Code-Build') {
            steps {
               sh 'mvn clean package'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Containerize the application'){
            steps { 
               echo 'Creating Docker image'
               sh "docker build -t abhipraydh96/insure:v1 ."
            }
        }
        
        stage('Docker Push') {
    	agent any
          steps {
       	withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'dockerhub', passwordVariable: 'dockerHubPassword', usernameVariable: 'dockerHubUser')]) {
            	sh "docker login -u ${env.dockerHubUser} -p ${env.dockerHubPassword}"
                sh 'docker push abhipraydh96/insure:v1'
        }
      }
    }
